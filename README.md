# MHI-Domoticz

Copied some stuff from https://github.com/jeatheak/Mitsubishi-WF-RAC-Integration, so all credits goes there.

Change ip-adress in shell script.
Copy everything somewhere in a subdirectory.

first try to run the command from the commandline: python3 mhi.py --print <ip-address airco>
You maybe have to add some python libraries. You will see when running this command.
Use dzventz.txt in domoticz. Adjust path of shell script
Create devices as mentioned in dzVentz script.

There is some debug code left in the files. Ignore it.

I do not give any support on this.
